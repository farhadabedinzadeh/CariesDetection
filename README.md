# Unsupervised Caries Detection in Non-standardized Bitewing Dental X-Rays


In recent years, dental image processing has become a valuable diagnostic help for medical practitioners. Due to the non-uniform nature of dental X-rays, reliable diagnosis remain troublesome despite advancements in the area. This is due to the fact that existing systems diagnose caries using a deterministic approach based on a supervised learning model. Using an unsupervised learning model, this code is an algorithm based on an article which is named [Unsupervised Caries Detection in Non-standardized Bitewing Dental X-Rays](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50835-1_58#auth-D_-Osterloh)
It proposes a method for detecting caries across a range of non-uniform X-ray pictures. This technique seeks to discover probable caries characteristics within a tooth without comparing against a set of image-based criteria. The results demonstrate the practicality of an unsupervised learning strategy and the method's superiority over supervised alternatives.
